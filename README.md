# CsaHoSz_Backend

## Info
This was a fullstack university project, in which creating the API+Authentication+Authorization using Spring was my task.

## Database
- A mysql server instace is needed for the data persistence
- Must have a user, with the username:"admin", password:"csahosz"
- This user must have access to a database called "CsaHoSz"
- It can be connencted through port 3306
- **These can be changed in the resources/application.properties file**

## Auth
Authentication is done through Jason Web Tokens.
